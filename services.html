            <p>
                Spanning several decades and thousands of product certifications, our project managers and support engineers have developed
                fast and efficient methods and strategies to achieve the compliance outcomes you need.
            </p>
            <p>
                From pre-compliance testing and assistance with standards interpretations in order to achieve conformance for EMC, safety,
                Interworking and NEBS, we're able to follow through to achieve rapid 1st tier country certifications such
                as North America, CE marking for Europe and Japanese approvals from JATE, Telec and Denan

            </p>
            <p>
                Our offices and agents can then support your product rollout throughout Asia, South America and the Middle East, holding
                certifications on your behalf where necessary.


            </p>
            <p>
                Where testing in Government labs is necessary, our local offices and agents arrange importation of samples and the necessary
                customs clearance, liaise with the lab as to the minimum suite of tests required, hand carry test samples
                to the lab and where necessary, provide witness testing. For complex equipment that requires specific engineering
                support, we accompany a manufacturer's support engineer to the lab, provide necessary translations and work
                to solve any non-compliance issues that may arise.
